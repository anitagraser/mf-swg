We will be working primarily on the [OGC API - Moving Feature](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/movingfeatures/), but if it's a related topic, we'd love to hear from you.

This page summarizes the goal, schedule, and outcomes of the activities related to the code sprint. 


## Topics

In this code sprint, OGC API - Moving Features will cover the following topics:

Documentation
- [ ] Validation against the designed [Core APIs](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcna-auto-review/22-003.html#toc13)
- [ ] Validation of the designed APIs against the [Abstract Test Suite (ATS)](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcna-auto-review/22-003.html#toc36)

Development
- [ ] Further development of APIs not supported by [MF-API Server](https://github.com/aistairc/mf-api) (queryable API part)
- [ ] Fixes and refactorings to bring the MF-API Server in line with the latest [pygeoapi](https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi).
- [ ] Add OGC API - Moving Features as one of [pygeoapi's providers](https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/stable/data-publishing/index.html#providers-overview)

And AOB!
